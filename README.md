# Final Project code for Udacity's React Nanodegree.

This is a iphone app that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The
app allows users to create different decks and add flashcards with questions and
answers to those decks. Then lets the user take quizzes on those decks. The app
also reminds the user daily to take a quiz if the user hasn't taken one on this
day.
